"""
Find all the ESS strategies.

A strategy is ESS if it has fitness above all others when common, or if they are the same fitness then, has greater fitness when rare

Try to do this in an efficient way:
within a loop over all strategies (playing the role of "common"), 
a naive option would be to go through all possible strategies as "rare".
But as soon as one is found that can invade, we know that the "common" one is NOT an ESS.
Accordingly, we will try the most promising invaders first in this inner loop, starting with 
score_user and score_maker, followed by all the partial mimics of the common strategy, and finally going through everything as a last resort.
