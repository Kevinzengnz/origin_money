    Consider the interaction between an X individual with a Y individual:
    We step through all the 25 options for the 'case'=(Sx,Sy,Cx,Cy), where 
      Sx is 1 if the X player is `solvent', ie. has score above zero, and 2 if player is in 'extra surplus'.
      Cx is 1 if player is in `CAN` (== in surplus), and 0 if it is in Need;
      And similarly for the Y player.
    The strategies dictate what happens in each such case. 

    If Sx=0 AND (for the X player) ds= +1: include the case (Sx,Sy,Cx,Cy) in a set `alphaCases`
    If Sx=1 AND ds= +1: include in `betaCases`
    If Sx=1 AND ds= -1: include in `gammaCases`
    If Sx=2 AND ds= +1: include in `deltaCases`
    If Sx=2 AND ds= -1: include in `epsilonCases`

    If dh=1 (ie. X player helps): include in 'costCases'
    If dh=-1 (player is helped): include in 'benefitCases'
    
    Return these 7 sets as a single Dict from the name (e.g. 'alphaCases') to the Set.

    """
    Maynard-Smith and Price criteria for ESS is as follows. 
    They say a strategy `A` is ESS (ie. *un*-invadeable) if, for *every* B != A,
    EITHER 
      E(A,A) >  E(B,A)  ie. a rare B would be actively die out in a popn of A. 
    OR
      E(A,A) == E(B,A)  AND   E(A,B) > E(B,B), 
    i.e. B matches A in a popn of A, but A would invade pure B from rare.
    
    Our definition of `B can invade A' should be consistent.
    It should be the exact negation of itemwise part of the ESS definition, which is:
      Not (E(A,A) >  E(B,A))  AND  Not (E(A,A) == E(B,A) && E(A,B) > E(B,B))
    so that if this BinvadesA returns true, it would also have caused a failure of 
    A to be ESS in MaynardSmith-Price-ESS-finder.jl
    
    NOTE: sometimes we might want to exclude invasions that would only
    occur by neutral drift (at both extremes). 
    So we include a flag, ALLOW_NEUTRAL_INVASION, which defaults to true.
    
    Algorithm:
    First, run a rare B in a popn of A.
    If B is strictly worse, return false: B cannot invade.
    If B is strictly better, return true: clearly B can invade. 
    Only if they're equal do we consider the case of B becoming common.
    Run a rare A in a popn of B. IF A does strictly better, return false (B cannot actually invade). 
    Otherwise we return true: B could invade neutrally and even if it gets common, A can't beat it.
